Common
---
* Standardize bottom/top margin/padding/border to px, left/right to %
* [MVP] On mobile chrome, there is a visible 1px artifact between strips (sometimes?)

Footer
---
* Make footer-to-top image into button
* [MVP] Add design credit for Mark to footer
* Increase font size

Navbar
---
* [MVP] Fix hover, focus, active, visited on links
* Setting height: 10px on nav-shadow in sm to correct skew causes artifact
* In xs (320px), make logo vcenter somehow
* Replace navbar images with glyphs
* Link tab order
* Weird artifact where clicking on logo causes it to jump right

Home
---
* [MVP] Work on content
* In strip-recruit-train-place: make [sm,md] smaller/tighter instead of single
column stack
* Collapse recruit-train-place to carousel instead of stacking
* Investigate weird artifact where height of strip-build-your-scala-team jumps by 50px between sm -> md transition. choose-the-best-blank.png resizes from 548 to 598 for no reason?
* [MVP] On mobile, ribbons are not centered. Train image is too large.

How's it work?
---
* [MVP] Add clouds to hows-it-work[we-mentor-train-certify,you-interview-them] (using same technique from recruit-train-place)
* Collapse mentor-train-certify to carousel instead of stacking
* [MVP] On mobile, ribbons are not centered
