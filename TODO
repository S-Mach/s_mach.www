Navbar
---
* [MVP] Fix hover, focus, active, visited on links
* Tweak positioning to match mock up
* Lower margin on social buttons
* Setting height: 10px on nav-shadow in sm to correct skew causes artifact

Home

* [MVP] Use tutorial here to make proper cleaved-circle-button CSS: http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-simple-button-with-css-image-sprites
* [MVP] Work on content
* In strip-recruit-train-place: make [sm,md] smaller/tighter instead of single
column stack
* Collapse recruit-train-place to carousel instead of stacking
* Investigate weird artifact where height of strip-build-your-scala-team jumps by 50px between sm -> md transition. choose-the-best-blank.png resizes from 548 to 598 for no reason?
