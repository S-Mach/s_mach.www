<h3>We learn your tech&#8209;stack <b>and your team's Scala code&#8209;style</b></h3>
<hr>
<p>Just as every organization has its own unique culture, every software development shop has its own unique software
stack. Unfortunately not every talented software developer knows every software stack available. At S-Mach we learn your
software products your team is using for development from operating system to version control.  We then teach our
interns how to install, configure and work in your software development environment. The benefit to you is our interns
are able to begin contributing on their first day of work!</p>
